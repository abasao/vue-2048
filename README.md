2048 Game in Vue
==========
This is a clone of [2048-vue](https://github.com/pengfu/vue-2048). 
I'm generalizing model and refactoring code. Animation requires editing .scss file directly.

Implemented using Webpack, SASS, Vue 2

My goal is to move animation logic to JS to allow custom setting.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
